                <p>The University of Missouri (Mizzou) is excited to be hosting its 4<sup>th</sup> annual MU Plant Research Symposium entitled: "Applications of Modern Technology from Lab to Field". This symposium is a part of <a href="https://www.pioneer.com/home/site/about/research/PlantSciSymposiaSeries/" target="_blank">The Corteva agriscience Plant Sciences Symposia series  </a> , which provides an opportunity for the next generation of scientists to interact with both public and private experts through student-driven and organized events at different academic institutions worldwide.</p>
<p> The aim of this symposium is to bring together numerous groups across Mizzou, other universities, and the community with vastly diverse research directed towards a unified goal: improving crops to solve problems facing food and agriculture today. In connection, participants presenting a poster or a talk will  be required to have a section focusing on how their research can be applied to improve tomorrow's crops.</p>
<p>The symposium welcomes all members of the scientific and surronding communities including, but not limited to, undergraduate students, graduate students, post-docs, technicians, high school students, and professors. Registration is free to all attendees. </p>
