Dr. Coe learned maize genetics from Dr. Charles Burnham at the University of Minnesota during B.S. and M.S. studies there. His Ph.D. at the University of Illinois was with Dr. John Laughnan (whose mentor was Dr. Lewis J. Stadler at the University of Missouri). At Illinois, in addition to Laughnan, Dr. Marcus Rhoades was a senior mentor. After a postdoc with Ernest G. Anderson at Caltech Coe joined the USDA-Agricultural Research Service and the University of Missouri, where he is currently Professor Emeritus of Plant Sciences. His research has contributed to sequencing of the genome and database development, and to anthocyanin biosynthesis, haploidy, epigenetics, and extrachromosomal inheritance. He is author or co-author of multiple refereed journal articles, and co-edited the noteworthy book, Mutants of Maize. Coe for 26 years was editor of the Maize Genetics Cooperation Newsletter (1974-2000). His honors include the prestigious Thomas Hunt Morgan Award from the Genetics Society of America in 1992, and others.

Dr. Tim Kelliher has a B.A in Biology from Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. During college he studied leaf cell fate specification under Professor Scott Poethig and Dr. Stuart Gillmor at the University of Pennsylvania, and then studied germinal cell fate acquisition in Drosophila under Professor Steven DiNardo.  He has a Ph.D. in Biology from Stanford University, where he studied with Professor Virginia Walbot the topic of reproductive cell fate specification in maize. He joined Syngenta in 2013 and cloned the haploid inducer gene in maize MATRILINEAL and used this gene to developed haploid induction in rice and other crops. He then developed a method of elite germplasm editing while producing non-transgenic doubled haploids (HI-Edit). He is a Science Fellow at Syngenta and run the Breeding Technology Group in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina and he is a science leader of two research programs (Genome Editing Application Technologies, and New Innovation).

<img src="/img/2022_Yunde Zhao.jpg" alt="Dr. Yunde Zhao Photo"  width="180px" style="float: right" /> 
Dr. Yunde Zhao received his Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the University of Michigan, where he studied nitric oxide signaling mechanisms. Dr. Zhao received his postdoctoral training in the field of plant molecular genetics at the Salk Institute, where he was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Life Sciences Research Foundation. Currently, Dr. Yunde Zhao is a professor in the Section of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California San Diego (UCSD). He is also the director of Plant Biology of Food & Fuel for the 21st Century, UCSD. Dr. Zhao is the Editor-in-Chief of Plant Physiology. Dr. Zhao’s research is centered on two areas: 1) Development of gene editing technologies; 2) Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which auxin regulates plant development. Dr. Zhao invented several technologies including ribozyme-based guide RNA production, RUBY reporter for gene expression and plant transformation, and the Transgene-Killer CRISPR, which enables efficient isolation of edited, transgene free plants. Dr. Zhao played a leading role in solving the complete auxin biosynthetic pathway in plants.

Dr. Huirong Gao grew up in a small village in the countryside and developed a fascination with plants as a child. This led her to pursue her first degree from Beijing Agricultural University, now known as China Agricultural University, with a major in plant pathology. She went on to obtain a doctorate in plant biology from the University of Rhode Island. Following her studies, she was a research associate at the Noble Foundation in Oklahoma. Prior to joining Corteva in 2001, she was at the University of California, Berkeley working on a bacterial pathogen that causes blight disease in walnuts. Her passion is to find ways to improve plant health and to help plants tolerate various stresses. Her research is mostly focusing on 1) Improving genome editing efficiency in corn, soybean, wheat, canola and other crops; 2) Piloting company's newly developed CRISPR-Cas with plant traits of agronomic importance; 3) Editting target genes for product development; 4) Collaborating with internal groups and external organizations on various genome editing projects through Open Innovation.
