Dr. Chetelat is director of C.M. Rick Tomato Genetics Resource Center and a professor at Department of Plant Sciences at University of California-Davis. His lab studies prezygotic interspecific reproductive barriers using cultivated tomato and related Solanum species as a model, especially focusing on the pollen factors. His group is also creating introgression lines by transferring the genome of Solanum sitiens, species endemic to the Atacama Desert of chile, into the background of cultivated tomato.

Dr. Miller is a professor in the Department of Biology at Saint Louis University along with joint appointment at Donald Danforth Center and a Research Associate at Missouri Botanical Garden. Her lab studies evolution and plasticity of perennial crops using genetic data and patterns of gene expression and various plant traits including flowering time, fruit and seed chemistry, leaf shape, ion concentration and physiology for perennial crop improvement, the development of novel crops for natural systems agriculture, and the conservation of perennial plant genetic resources. Her ongoing project focusses on studying grafted grapevines to understand how different roots influence whole plant functions.

Dr. Bennett is a distinguished professor at Department of Plant Sciences at UC-Davis. He is also director of Public Intellectual Resource for Agriculture (PIPRA). His lab is mostly focused on the study of tomato fruit development and ripening, cell wall disassembly, plant association with diazotrophic microbiomes using molecular biology approach. He is also an AAAs fellow. Dr. Bennett’s team recently discovered a nitrogen fixing Maize landraces which opens up the new avenues in understanding and application of biological nitrogen fixation in cereals crops.

Dr. Springer is department chair of Botany and Plant sciences and professor of genetics at UC Riverside. Dr. Springer’s lab focusses on understanding the molecular events that regulate the development of leaves and other lateral organs that initiate the shoot apical meristem. Her lab is interested in understanding mechanisms that control the formation of a boundary between the SAM and organ primordia in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
