Dr. Guerinot is the Ronald and Deborah Harris Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Dartmouth College. She earned her bachelor’s degree in biology at Cornell University and her Ph.D. in biology from Dalhousie University, followed by postdoctoral studies at the University of Maryland and at the DOE–MSU Plant Research Laboratory.  At Dartmouth, where she rose through the ranks to full professor, she has served as chair of the Department of Biological Sciences, as Associate Dean of the Faculty for the Sciences and as Vice Provost.  She has also served as a member of the Advisory Committee for Biological Sciences at the National Science Foundation, is a Past President and past Chair of the Board of Trustees of the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB) and is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and ASPB.  She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2016.  She is a recipient of the Dartmouth Graduate Mentoring Award, the Dean of Faculty Award for Outstanding Mentoring and Advising and the Dennis R. Hoagland Award and Stephen Hales Prize from ASPB. Dr. Guerinot pioneered research on metal metabolism in plants through key discoveries of genes involved in major transport processes for minerals such as iron and zinc. Her research is critically important for both agriculture and human nutrition since iron and zinc deficiencies affect billions of humans that rely upon crop-based diets.

Mockler is the Geraldine and Robert Virgil distinguished investigator at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. He received his bachelor’s degree in molecular biology from Wesleyan University in Connecticut and his doctorate in molecular biology at the University of California – Los Angeles. He has helped lead several international consortia that have sequenced plant genomes, including the Brachypodium distachyon, Oropetium thomaeum, strawberry, and black raspberry genomes and the sorghum pan-genome project. His research has also included the development of genomic and bioinformatic tools, with the end goal of improving crop performance and yield. Areas of study include gene regulatory networks, plant abiotic stress responses, genome sequencing and analysis, and high-throughput phenotyping. His published work provides critical tools and approaches for using large-scale multi-omics datasets to understand complex biological systems. In 2012, Dr. Mockler co-founded Benson Hill Biosystems, a crop improvement company unlocking the natural diversity of plants.

## Dr. Nonoy Bandillo <br/>
#### *Department of Plant Sciences, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND* <br/>

Dr. Bandillo is an assistant professor in the Department of Plant Sciences at North Dakota State University (NDSU). He directs the pulse crops breeding and genetics program (https://pulsecropsbreeding.weebly.com/) for the NDSU, which releases new cultivars of pea, chickpea and lentil for the Northern Great Plains region. Specific goal of the program is to develop early maturing high-yielding cultivars and germplasm with improved disease resistance, excellent agronomic performance, and superior quality attributes best suited for landscapes (soils and topography), climate, markets, and value-added potential for the Northern Great Plains region. Current research interests include development and evaluation of advanced breeding tools and emerging technologies, including genomic selection and high-throughput phenotyping, for increasing genetic gain in pulse crops. Bandillo teaches graduate courses on topics in plant breeding and quantitative genetics. <br/>
Prior to joining NDSU, he was a postdoctoral research associate at the Buckler Lab at Cornell University in maize and sorghum quantitative genetics. He began his career as an assistant scientist in rice breeding and genetics at the International Rice Research Institute, where he was part of a team that pioneered the development of Multi-parent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) populations in rice. Bandillo received his Ph.D. at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where he worked on the integration of genomic selection in a soybean breeding program and tapping of diversity in the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection.

## Dr. James Janni <br/>
#### *Corteva Agroscience, Johnston, IA* <br/>

<img src="/img/2020Janni.png" alt="Dr. James Janni Photo"  width="180px" style="float: left" /> 

Dr. Janni is a Corteva Agriscience Fellow and senior technology leader in R&D. He earned his BS in chemistry from Iowa State University and PhD in physical chemistry from MIT. He started his career building spectrometers and sensors for landmine detection under the DARPA dog’s nose project, a natural extension of his studies in vibrational spectroscopic detection of explosive vapors. Technology and method development have been the focus of his career since. He came to Pioneer to develop Raman spectroscopy for amino acid characterization in grain. This project quickly shifted to the development of single seed NIR hardware, software and predictive analytics for characterizing segregating populations of oil modified seeds. He then assembled a team to examine the value in improving seed analysis with spectral imaging. Dr. Janni joined a team that combined predictive analytics and metabolomics to predict phenotypes in the greenhouse and field using greenhouse imaging. He recognized the needed sensitivity to stressors in the field and UAS sensing was born from deploying hyperspectral to the field. He collaborated with many to demonstrate the value of UAS field sensing. The work in NIR grain analysis, greenhouse hyperspectral imaging, and UAS sensor, platform and algorithm development continues in his group today with broad applications and connections to other Corteva functions. James was recently named to the inaugural class of Research Fellows at Corteva..
