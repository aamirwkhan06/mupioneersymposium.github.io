## *Abstract Presentation:*
The symposium committee will select four abstracts for the Abstract Presentation based on the work importance, the new and exciting research findings, and accessibility to a broad audience. Authors of the abstracts selected for the oral presentations will be informed by email mupltsciplantrese1@umsystem.edu by TBA.
<br/><br/>
The allocated time for the presentation is 15 minutes followed by 5 minutes for questions. The applicants not selected for the Abstract Presentation will be considered for Lightning Talks upon request.
<br/><br/>

## *Lightning Talk:*
All lightning talk presenters are requested to record a 4-5 min long video presentation about their research. The videos will be available on the Symposium website and will be evaluated by a selected judge committee. All Lightning Talks will be accepted.
<br/><br/>
Video presentation should be send to mupltsciplantrese1@umsystem.edu due TBA</a>. For your own video success, do not wait until the last minute to send it.
<br/><br/>
The top three presentations will receive a prize based on the video presentation and Panel Discussion participation.
