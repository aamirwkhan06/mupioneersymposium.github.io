## What are the differences between Abstract Presentation and Lightning Talk?
<hr style="clear: both;" />

## *Abstract Presentation:*
The symposium committee will select four abstracts for the Abstract Presentation based on the work importance, the new and exciting research findings, and accessibility to a broad audience. Authors of the abstracts selected for the oral presentations will be informed by email mupltsciplantrese1@umsystem.edu by January 31.
<br/><br/>
The allocated time for the presentation is 15 minutes followed by 5 minutes for questions. The applicants not selected for the Abstract Presentation will be considered for Lightning Talks upon request.
<br/><br/>

## *Lightning Talk:*
All lightning talk presenters are requested to present a 4-5 min presentation about their research. The presentations will be evaluated by a selected judge committee. All Lightning Talks will be accepted.
<br/><br/>
The top three presentations will receive a prize based on the presentation and Panel Discussion participation.
